Controls: 
 * Press in any place to teleport around. 
 * Press on Mars globe to give it a spin.

## What is that?
This is just a sample project made for [Udacity VR](https://www.udacity.com/vr) course.
The goal of the project was to familiarise with Unity basics of animations, materials, scripting, lightmaps, and optimizations for mobile.

## Installation & Building
 * Open project in Unity 5.4.x.
 * Import [GoogleVR SDK package](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/download).
 * Set platform to Android and build (it may work for iOS, but this was not tested)

## Binary

### Disclaimer
Yes, these windows and door look rather silly on Mars and will lead to death :-)
